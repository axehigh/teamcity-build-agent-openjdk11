# TeamCity-Agent-OpenJDK11

**This image is larger than the default agent**

 This image is an extension of the [TeamCity Agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-agent/) managed by JetBrains.  [See here](https://hub.docker.com/r/jetbrains/teamcity-agent/) for instructions on use and launching the agent.
 
 It's further an extension of [Blurryworks Teamcity Agent](ttps://hub.docker.com/r/blurryworks/teamcity-agent-more-jdk).

 This agent includes OpenJDK 11 as an alternative to the included 1.8 JDK build in the agent.  This is a Linux environment. The additional builds are added to /usr/lib/jvm which is scanned automatically by the Agent on load.
